    <h2>Introduction of myself: </h2>
    <p>
        My name is Zhenxing Zheng, most of the people have difficulty to pronoun my name so most of time I prefer use 
        another name <em>Lay</em>. Something about me is that I am an indenpedent and friednly guys. I do everything myself, never depend 
        on someone else and asking for help unless I have to. If someone is asking me for help, I would do anything I can to help, 
        unless there are nothing I can do, then I will keep slience. 
    </p>

        Something I do during free time are designing, watching horry movies and exercise. I am the person who enjoy drawing in both
        pencil or digital and sharing my artworks. I love visit some websites where artists sharing their arts with video for the drawing process so I can
        learn from the way how they desgin their work. For me, I do charaters desgin, environmental design and animation design. Well I also love to watching those horry movies either alone or with
        friends, and I prefer duing night with dark surrounding. I do not know why, but I really enjoy the feeling of getting
        shocked by some horry stuffs. Excercise is my hobby, I enjoy sweat a lot and I play most of the sports. My favorite are biking and wall climbing. 
        I used to afraid of height till I tried wall climbing, it just stops my fear and making me focus on climbing instead of my surrounding.

        Things I hate the most are <em>having a conversation that would last for long period of time, stay in crowed, and doing something I do not like.</em> 
        I am not that kind of person who likes to talk so much, I prefer working in a quiet place. Staying in an environment with crowed just 
        making me feel so <strong>UNCOMFORTABLE AND ANNOYED</strong> I always use my best effort on things I like no matter what it costs, but for things I do not like, I would 
        probably choose not to do or working on it with my one eye close.
